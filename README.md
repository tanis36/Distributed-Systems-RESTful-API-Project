# Distributed-Systems-RESTful-API-Project
A group project for a Distributed Systems class that uses a C++ key value store library (which can be found in one of my other repositories), PyBind11, and a Flask app to give distributed access to our KVS via a RESTful API. Clients can use this API to access storage on a server, where K/V pairs can be safely kept and shared.
